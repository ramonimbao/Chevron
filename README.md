## Files

There are three folders: `bottom`, `main-pcb`, `plate`. Inside each of them are a `gerbers` production folder, and a `kicad` source folder. Grab the gerber zip files from the `gerbers` folder.

The clear cover for the components is in the `misc` folder. There's also a foot you can laser cut to be used with the bottom. Needs M2 brass standoffs or screws to use.

## Notes

High profile case files (seen in the photo) are not provided.

The KiCAD project was made with KiCAD 5.1.4, and have not been updated.
